# WebAssembly runner and tools

This repository contains various tools for working with WebAssembly, including a parser, a decoder, an interpreter and several example programs for use in testing. **None of this is intended for use in production**, and is only meant for learning purposes.

## WebAssembly versions

The tools in this repo are based on [WebAssembly 2.0](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/versions/core/WebAssembly-2.0.pdf), but I might eventually add support for version 3.0 as well.
